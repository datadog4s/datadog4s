# Migration to `io.github`

Starting November 2025, datadog4s now lives under new `group id`. It is now using `io.github.datadog4s`. The goal was to
decouple from Avast Software and to ensure continuity of the project. 

All the classes now also live under `io.github.datadog4s` namespace. Please, update your imports and build files
accordingly.
