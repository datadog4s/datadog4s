Toolkit for monitoring applications written in functional Scala using Datadog and Cats.

Goal of this project is to make great monitoring as easy as possible. 

In addition to basic monitoring utilities, we also provide a bunch of plug-and-play modules that do monitoring for you. Currently, those are:
-   JVM monitoring
-   Http4s monitoring
